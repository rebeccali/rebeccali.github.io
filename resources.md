This is a list of resources of things which I find useful, want to find useful, have found useful in the past. If you have a resource which you would like to contribute to the list, let me know. This was inspired by [Laura Deming's Longevity FAQ](https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq/).

# Control And Estimation
### Classical Control
* __Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems__, Franklin. An excellent classical control resource.

### Kalman Filtering
* [Good ol' wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)
* [Extended Kalman Filter, the Interactive tutorial](https://home.wlu.edu/~levys/kalman_tutorial/)
* Gibbs, __Advanced Kalman Filtering, Least Squares, and Modeling: A Practical Handbook__
* [Wan, van der Merwe - “The Unscented Kalman Filter for Least Squares Estimation”](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/unscented.pdf)
* [Kalman and Baysian Filters in Python]
(https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python). A fun iPython notebook for exploring this.

# Convex Optimization
* [GPKit](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - A cool convex optimization tool for design. By the very wonderful and talented Ned Burnell.

# Math
* [Intro to Linear Dynamical Systems (class)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE263). This is on my To-do.
* [Algebra, Topology, Differential Calculus, and Optimization theory for Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/math-basics.pdf). A massive tome from University of Pennsylvania which seems to cover most things in mathematics you might want to know as an engineer.
* [A description of L-0 to L-Infinity norms](https://rorasa.wordpress.com/2012/05/13/l0-norm-l1-norm-l2-norm-l-infinity-norm/)
* Strogatz - __Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos__. Suggested by Laurens Gunnarsen, as well as Strogatz's [Stanford course with online lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V).

# Aerodynamics

* Anderson - __Introduction to Aerodynamics__. "Everything you need to know about aerodynamics is in chapters one through four" - Damon Vander Lind
* McLean - __Understanding Aerodynamics: Arguing from the Real Physics__

# Programming Languages

### Haskell

* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) - a cute, approachable, simple introduction to Haskell's subjects.
* [Hoogle](https://haskell.org/hoogle) - You know, Google, but for Haskell.
* [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) - An essential part of the Haskell build system and package management.

### Rust
* [Operating Systems course in Rust](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140e/). An operating systems course from Stanford. The course consists of writing an operating system from the ground up in Rust on a Raspberry Pi.

# Builder/Maker blogs
People who do really cool things.
* [Shutter Clicks](https://www.lycarter.com/) - Landon Carter, my undergraduate parter in bad decisions. Photographer, programmer, roboter.
* [Equals Zero](http://etotheipiplusone.net/) - Charles Guan, van/truck/robot/powertool/motorcontroller lover
* [Build-its](http://build-its.blogspot.com/) - mechanical/electronical/controls blog with impressive builds like the world's fastest rubik's cube solver.
* [Isopack](http://isopack.blogspot.com/) - Reverse engineer wizard, firmware whisperer, camera enthusiast
* [Amy Qian](https://amymakesstuff.com/) - All around awesome maker
* [Transistor Man](http://transistor-man.com/Index.html) - a weird guy I met at the MIT reactor once
* [MITERS](http://miters.mit.edu/) - a magical makerspace at MIT where I grew up as an engineer.
* [Jeremy Trilling](http://www.jeremyelantrilling.com/) - a fantastic young maker I met while at Kitty Hawk.
