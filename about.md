Last Updated: July 2021

I grew up in Milwaukee, WI with music and video games. After getting my BS in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in 2017, I moved to Palo Alto, CA. I worked for [Kitty Hawk][kittyhawk] as a controls engineer. I worked on various control systems and software for a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) electric aircraft that cemented my love of flying, controls, and Haskell. I pursued my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania under [Dr. Vijay Kumar][kumarlab] and [Dr. Mark Yim][modlab] from 2018-2021, focusing on incorporating learning into swarm control and safety critical systems. I left with a masters during the pandemic and am now figuring out how best to apply my skills to solve climate change. 

As an amateur, I am currently learning guitar, photography, and eventually mountaineering. Past projects I wish I had more time for include BattleBots(tm), electric vehicles, power electronics, classical guitar, violin, piano, kites, hiking, rock climbing, web design, jiu jitsu, and painting.
