- **Rotation:** Rotate plants regularly using sticker method for even growth
- **Indoor Transition:** Bring tropicals inside below 50°F, herbs and succulents below 40°F
- **Grow Lights:** Required for succulents indoors, lower shelves get less light
- **September Tasks:** Move side succulents to black table Sept 22, take progress photos
- **When Unsure:** For succulents, wait an extra 3 days before watering
